### Soccer vs. Football

The difference between football and soccer primarily lies in regional
terminology and the style of the game played.

In most parts of the world, including Europe, South America, Africa, and 
Asia, "football" refers to what Americans call "soccer." This version of 
football involves two teams of 11 players each competing to score goals by 
kicking a round ball into the opponent's net, primarily using feet, head, 
or body (except for the goalkeeper) without handling the ball with hands 
or arms during play, except for the goalkeeper within their penalty area.

In the United States and Canada, "football" refers to a different sport 
known as American or Canadian football. This game involves two teams of 11
 players each trying to advance an oval-shaped ball down the field to score 
touchdowns by carrying or passing it, with players wearing protective gear 
and employing tactics involving both running and passing.

The key distinctions include the shape of the ball, the style of play, the 
rules, and the terminology used in different regions. Both football (soccer) 
and American/Canadian football are immensely popular in their respective areas, 
contributing to the global landscape of sports in their unique ways.
