## Recipe for Yellow Cake

Yellow cake is delicious!  This recipe is passed down from my great-great-grandparents.

My great-great-grandparents lived in Venice. They enjoyed traveling on the canals.
Did you know Venice became Austrian territory when Napoleon signed the Treaty of Campo 
Formio on 12 October 1797? I did not.

### Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 cups white sugar
- 1/2 cup of shortening
- 3 eggs
- 1 cup milk 
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Directions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.

Mix the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl.

Beat sugar and shortening together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.

Add eggs, one at a time, beating thoroughly after each adding each egg. 

Slowly add the flour mixture and milk, beating just to combine. 

Stir in vanilla and pour cake batter into the prepared pan.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 40 to 45 minutes.
